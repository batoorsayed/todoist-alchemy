# Todoist Alchemy: AI-Powered Task Organization System

## Core Functionality

The system processes task entries and transforms them by:
1. Reading unorganized tasks that don't already have the "[TA]" or "!" marker
2. Cleaning up task names for clarity and consistency (required)
3. Adding short, informative descriptions that explain the purpose and scope (required)
4. Estimating required work hours using consistent format [1h], [20m], [1.5h], etc. (required)
5. Adding due dates only for genuinely urgent tasks (rarely needed)
6. Assigning priority levels from P1 (highest) to P4 (lowest) (required)
7. Adding relevant labels for categorization based on my time-block system (required)
8. Associating with appropriate projects and sections (required when applicable)
9. Breaking down into subtasks only when truly necessary (include description and time estimates for each)
10. Identifying and merging or grouping similar tasks when appropriate

## Task Processing Rules

The system follows these guidelines when processing tasks:
- Preserve tasks marked with "!" at description
- Skip tasks already marked with "[TA]" at the end of the description
- Skip tasks that are in a shared project
- Create clear, action-oriented task names that start with verbs
- Generate concise descriptions (1-3 sentences) that provide context
- Estimate work hours based on task complexity and scope and add it to description
- Only add due dates for time-sensitive items with clear deadlines
- Assign priority based on:
  * P1: Urgent and important (must be done today/soon)
  * P2: Important but not urgent (should be done soon)
  * P3: Normal priority tasks
  * P4: Low priority, nice-to-have tasks
- Apply time-block labels appropriately:
  * Deep Work (10:00 AM - 1:15 PM): Complex, high-focus tasks
  * Learning Block (2:00 PM - 2:30 PM): Reading, learning activities
  * Quick Wins (2:30 PM - 4:00 PM): Simple, fast-completion tasks
  * Day Close (4:00 PM - 5:00 PM): End-of-day tasks, planning
  * Evening Time (7:00 PM - 10:00 PM): Personal activities
  * Weekend (12:00 PM - 7:00 PM): Weekend-specific tasks
- Only create subtasks for complex items that truly benefit from breakdown
- Always mark processed tasks with "[TA]" at the end of the description
- If unsure about project, label assignment, or description, ask for clarification instead of guessing
- Balance thoroughness with practical utility - avoid creating excessive structure
